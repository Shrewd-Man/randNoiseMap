# randNoiseMap


## Description
This is a project of mine where I develop and test some methods for making noise maps such as Perlin noise. It's intended for experimentation and inspiration rather than as a standalone program.

## Installation
The project isn't meant to be installed as a standalone program but instead be used as a reference in developing noise maps with c. The code can be found in the "randNoiseMap > randNoiseMap > main.c" file.

## Usage
 - Feel free to use or modify any part of this code as you see fit.
 - No restrictions, no attribution required.
 - The implementations may not be the most efficient, but they offer insight into different noise generation techniques.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! Feel free to submit a pull request if you have improvements or optimizations. I'm always looking for ways to make this project better.
