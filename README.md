# randNoiseMap


## Description
This is a project of mine where I develop and test some methods for making noise maps such as perlin noise. It's intended for experimentation and inspiration rather than as a standalone program.

## Installation
The project isn't meant to be installed as a standalone program, but instead be used as a reference in developing noise maps with c.

## Usage
 - Feel free to use or modify any part of this code as you see fit.
 - No restrictions, no attribution required.
 - The implementations may not be the most efficient, but they offer insight into different noise generation techniques.

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you have improvements or optimizations, feel free to submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to make this project better.
